# Scenario A
Hi **Raju**,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding this matter. We hope you're doing well.

Upon checking our record of the meeting, dated **June 26, 2021**, you were only present for a total of **10 minutes**.

As per the [course policy](https://mock.policy), you are required to **be present for at least half of the entire session** to be considered "Present" for that day's session. Make sure to stay through out the session so you don't miss any important details about the topic!

To avoid any more forced absences, you may opt to **request for an excused absence**. You can do this for as early as **3 months** before the excused absence. To do this, head to your CodePath [Course Portal](https://courses.codepath.com/sessions), click the **Quick Actions** dropdown tab, and select ***Request Excused Absence***.

Some tips to remember before, during, and after your day's session:
* Before the session, make sure you are already registered and you have the necessary log in credentials for the session.
* Make sure that you have a stable internet connection. This is to ensure that you are present all through out the session.
* During the session, actively participate if you can. Your instructor will surely appreaciate if you give them realtime feedbacks and questions about the topic. We're sure your coursemates will appreciate that too!
* After the session, you will be able to access the record of the meeting should you want to watch it once more for clarifications.

If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out!
