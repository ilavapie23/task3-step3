# Scenario B

Hi **Pia**!

Thank you for reaching out to us. We hope you're doing well!

We saw from your coursework submissions, albeit being marked as late, your eagerness to continue with the course and to learn more about Cybsercurity. You've explained from your previous email that you are currently attending the university with a full load, and you're also working on the side. We don't want you to overwork yourself. **More than anything else, we also value  your well-being.**

Your withdrawal from the course does not mean we booted you out entirely off of the system. You will still have lifetime access to our [course materials](https://cybersecurity-course-materials.sample) , but you will no longer be able to attend live sessions. You will also not be asked to submit weekly courseworks. 

What we can suggest is that you **enroll next semester** **when you have less unit load in the university, and therefore better availability**. We can look at it this way -- since you still have access to course materials, you can review and prepare yourself even more for the next semester's Cybersecurity course, on your own pace. We're also encouraging you to subscribe to our [mailing list](https://https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) so that you get the latest updates on upcoming courses and events.

**We look forward to seeing you on Spring 2022!**

All the best,
Gab Reyes
Cybersecurity Course Head
