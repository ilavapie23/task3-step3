# Scenario C

Hi **Farhan**!

By the way, good work on getting vaccinated! We love to see a responsible citizen!

We appreciate you reaching out to us regaring this matter. It was really unfortunate that you were not able to make the first deadline and the 48-hour extension for late submissions.

With regards to technical difficulties, we advice participants to check our [**Slack Unit Help Channels**](https://slack.com) or the [**Discussion System**](https://discussions.codepath.com/), so our team can help you sort out your problem. This has also been clearly stated on the [course policy](https://mock.policy).

If you have any record (e.g picture, video recording) of the technical problem you experienced in our platform, **we suggest that you  also send it to us to help assess the possibility of an extension.**

Should you have any more questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us!



All the best,


CodePath.org team
